1.Create a cloud storage bucket (do not upload any file yet) with default setting
2.Create an BigQuery Dataset
3.Create event driven cloud function â€“ for this demo we have cloud function v1
4.Create python function to upload the data to BigQuery or you can use one of the two python function provided in the git repo:
	a - Version 1 - write data to BigQuery
	b - Version 2 - + write metadata about the file that has been uploaded to BigQuery
5.Deploy the cloud function
6.Upload one of the CSV file into a cloud storage bucket.
7.Check the cloud function log to see if it has picked it up.
8.Now navigate back to BigQuery and see if you can see the dataset and query it.
