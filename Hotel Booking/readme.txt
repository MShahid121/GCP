Background:
You have been hired as data engineer to help support data sciences to implement a mode in predicting hotel booking. 
Here are the list of task which need to be carried out before passing it over to the data scientist to build a custom model. 

Data Pre-processing: 
• Gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset through summarisation and basic data checks. you should examine data types and identify missing values. 
• Employ suitable techniques to address missing or inconsistent values. Handle the outliers as well. 
• Do the necessary data type conversions for columns to help with ML model. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
• Extract valuable insights from the dataset that could benefit hotel management, including the following at minimum: 
• Calculating cancellation percentages for City and Resort hotels.
• Identifying the most frequently ordered meal types. 
• Determining the number of returning guests. 
• Finding the most booked room types.
• Exploring correlations between room types and cancellation (Heatmap – python Jupyter notebook) 
ML Modelling for Pov using BigQueryML:
• Random Forest
• Decision Tree
